1.1 The Elements of Programming

Every programming language has these three mechanisms:

Primitive expressions, the simplest entities the language is concerned with.
Means of combinations, compound elements are built from simpler ones.
Means of abstractions, compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

1.1.1 Expressions

Expressions such as these ((+ 2000 19), (* 25 4)), formed by delimiting a list of expressions within parentheses in order to denote procedure application, are called combinations.

The leftmost element ... called operator ... and the other elements are called operands.

Then applying the procedure specified by the operator to the arguments that are the values of operands.
